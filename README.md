# **Flork life decisions**

This project corresponds to the first integrative task of the course "Computation and Discrete Structures III". The objective of this project was to apply the knowledge acquired about powerful computational models e.g. Automata, Transducers and Grammars. Also, apply regular expressions to identify patterns in text strings.

The following tools were used to develop this project:

* Visual Studio Code.
* Python - Programming language used in the course.
* Pyformlang programming library to use the computational models described above.
* PyQt5 programming library for GUI design.

In order to run the project you must download the libraries described above with the following commands:


<pre>
    pip install pyformlang
    pip install PyQt5
</pre>
